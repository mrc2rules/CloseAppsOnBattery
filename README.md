# CloseAppsOnBattery

Automatically closes power-hungry apps when your laptop switches to battery power — helping extend your battery life.

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you unplug your laptop, apps like Discord or Nvidia Broadcast may continue running in the background, draining your battery. This tool sets up a Task Scheduler trigger to automatically close such apps when switching to battery mode.

## 📥 Installation Guide

1. **Download the `files.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/mrc2rules/CloseAppsOnBattery/releases)**

2. **Extract the ZIP archive** to any folder

3. Open search, type `Task Scheduler`, and open it

4. On the right-hand panel, click **“Import Task…”**
   Then select `CloseAppsOnBattery.xml` from the folder you extracted.

5. In the imported task, go to the **Actions** tab → Select the listed action → Click **Edit**
